<p>This book is intended for system programmers who want to exploit the
features of their target operating system to the max. First disclaimer:
If the target platform of your software is Windows 95, 98, or Me
(Millennium Edition), don't read any further. Due to the architectural
differences of the Windows 9x/Me and NT/2000 platforms, you won't have
any benefit from reading this book. Second disclaimer: I am not going to
write anything about the Alpha processor or multi-processor systems - I
will target the 32-bit Intel i386 single-processor platform exclusively.
Third disclaimer: Be aware that this text is not written for the
faint-hearted. You will be faced with programming techniques the average
Win32 programmer hasn't ever seen before. The Windows 2000 kernel is an
entirely different world, bearing very little resemblance to the Win32
subsystem built upon it. Some of the interfacing techniques introduced
towards the end of the book might be new even to experienced kernel-mode
programmers. Let me put it this way: This is the book your high-school
teachers and Microsoft representatives have always warned you about!</p>

<p>If you are still reading on, you are obviously an open-minded,
courageous person who wants to know everything about the things lurking
beneath the surface of the Windows 2000 operating system. That's great!
Even if you won't use the know-how you gain from this book on an
every-day basis, you will certainly benefit from it continuously.
Knowing what is going on under the surface of an application interface
is always advantageous. It facilitates debugging and optimization, and
helps avoiding unwanted side effects caused by misconceptions of the
hidden mechanics of the system.</p> 

<p>The only expertise I'm expecting from my readers is "talking C"
fluently, and basic knowledge of Win32 programming. If you have already
written kernel-mode drivers, you're in an even better position, but
that's not a requirement. You will find an introduction to kernel-mode
driver programming in this book, telling you everything you need to know
within its scope. However, please note that this is not a comprehensive
kernel-mode tutorial. If you are specifically interested in kernel-mode
driver development, please get one of the good books that deal with this
topic exclusively (e.g. Viscarola & Mason 1999, or Dekker & Newcomer
1999).</p> 

<p>In some chapters of this book, I make heavy use of inline assembly
language (ASM), because this was the only feasible way to get things
done. I don't expect you to have thorough ASM programming experience,
but a basic knowledge of ASM is certainly helpful here. If you have
never written a line of ASM code, you might get somewhat uneasy while
reading these chapters, or you might even choose to skip them entirely.
However, I encourage you to read at least parts of them, only skipping
the subsections that explain the details of the ASM code. Because the
ASM code snippets used in the samples are always well encapsulated in C
function wrappers, you can usually ignore their internals and still
benefit from the remaining material that surrounds them.</p>
