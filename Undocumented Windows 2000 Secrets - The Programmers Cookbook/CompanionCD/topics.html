<p>After introducing you to the basic architecture of Windows 2000 and
helping you to set up your workstation for Windows 2000 kernel
spelunking, this book leads you through some very exciting corners
inside the world of kernel programming. Typically, each chapter first
tells you the essential theory you need to know about the topic, and
then immediately steps to some sample code that illustrates the usage of
the respective features. The language chosen for the samples is plain C.
The probability is high that the readers of this book are comfortable
with C, and this language is well supported by Microsoft's Windows 2000
development tools.</p> 

<p>This book does deliberately not attempt to give a broad overview of
the architecture of the Windows 2000 kernel, although it discusses parts
of it in some chapters. If you are looking for such information, stick
to "Inside Windows 2000" (Solomon & Russinovich 2000) instead, which
takes a very general and theoretical approach to the Windows 2000
internals. However, if you want to see practical code examples and
full-featured sample applications that interact live with the system,
neither "Inside Windows 2000" nor the "Windows NT / 2000 Native API
Reference" (Nebbett 2000) take you very far. This is where my book
enters the scene. It contains reprinted code samples in abundance,
accompanying the Windows 2000 concepts and features under discussion,
and the companion CD comprises all of this code in ready-to-run
applications that you can extend, tear to shreds for use in other
applications, or simply use as is. Basically, you will be led through
the following topics:</p> 

<ul>
<li>Using the Windows 2000 debugging interfaces.</li>
<li>Loading, parsing, and utilizing the Windows 2000 symbol files.</li>
<li>Dissecting the Microsoft PDB file format.</li>
<li>Interfacing to the kernel's Native API.</li>
<li>Writing simple kernel-mode drivers.</li>
<li>Exploring Windows 2000 system memory.</li>
<li>Hooking and monitoring calls to the Native API.</li>
<li>Calling kernel functions from user-mode applications.</li>
<li>Calling non-exported kernel functions.</li>
<li>Exploring the world of Windows 2000 kernel objects.</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides this, you will learn many more tiny details about the system
along the way, packed into the text and samples. My foremost intention
while writing the manuscript was to share with you anything I knew about
the topics I was writing about.</p>
